# A Windows window manager for power users

The goal of this application is to allow users to manipulate and manage windows _without_ the mouse.

Fenestra operates on monitors and windows, but also implements the concept of _workspaces_ (akin to Windows Virtual
Desktops).<br>
Each monitor contains 10 workspaces, and each workspace contains any number of windows.<br>

As a visual aid, Fenestra was designed with the following hierarchy in mind:

- Monitors
    - Workspaces
        - Windows
